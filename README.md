# Hi, I’m Ondrej 👋

Software Engineer (AI-Focused) with a strong background in building and scaling
AI-powered products end-to-end — from frontend and backend systems to applied AI workflows
running in production.

I enjoy ownership-heavy roles where I can design systems holistically, ship to real users,
and work closely with product and business stakeholders.

---

## 🧠 What I work on

- **AI product engineering**: LLM-based systems (RAG), document automation, STT/TTS interfaces  
- **Full-stack development**: React / Next.js, Python (FastAPI, Django), REST APIs  
- **Production systems**: authentication & authorization (RBAC, RLS), reliability, cloud deployment  
- **Applied AI**: building AI features that augment users rather than remain research demos
